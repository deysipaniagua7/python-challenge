# python-challenge
This is the repository that holds my Module 3 Python-Challenge reupload.

Module Overview: Create a python script to analyze a company's financial records by calculating: total # of months, net total, profit/losses changes and average of change, and greatest increase/decrease in profit. Create a python script to analyze votes by calculating: total # of votes, list of candidates w/votes, % of votes/candidate, total # of votes/candidate, and election winner.

Please note, I wasn't sure if we were supposed to attached files/output but I did it just in case.

Also, I requested/received help from 3 people through Slack's AskBCS Lerning Assistant and used the following resources:
